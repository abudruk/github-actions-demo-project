"""
This plugin is required as part of the Tintri UI Extension. It provides one of
the actions exposed on a Tintri server tab.

This Server Action should be Disabled so that it isn't shown as a button on server 
detail pages. Instead, it's rendered directly by the Tintri UI extension.

Prompts user for one runtime input: snapshot name.
